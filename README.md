# 🛒 Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation & Product Recommendation
## 📌 Project Overview

Shopper Spectrum is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that analyzes e-commerce transaction data to:

- Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM Analysis + KMeans Clustering

- Recommend similar products using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (Cosine Similarity)

- Provide an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions and recommendations

This project helps businesses understand their customers better and apply data-driven marketing strategies.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Online shopping platforms generate a huge amount of customer transaction data every day, but this data is not fully utilized to understand customer behavior or improve business strategies. It becomes difficult to identify valuable customers, at-risk customers, and to recommend relevant products in a personalized way.

This project aims to:

- Segment customers based on purchase behavior

- Identify High-Value, Regular, Occasional, and At-Risk customers

- Build a product recommendation system

- Deploy everything as a web application
